# Pong-game

**Description:** This is a remake of the classic game, Pong! For this project, I used the Turtle library in Python.
It requires two players (or two hands) to play. If the ball goes out of bounds behind your paddle, the other player gets a point.
Also, each time the ball is hit by a paddle it increases in speed! 

**Controls**: 

Player 1: **W** to go up, **S** to go down.

Player 2: **Up arrow** to go up, **down arrow** to go down.
